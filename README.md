# Why Go for backend development?

1. It's easy to learn and the syntax is easy to read.
2. It's fast and supports a high number of concurrent connections (hundreds of thousands) per compute instance.
3. There are many high-quality Go libraries that we can use.
4. Go is popular for web development so there are a lot of tutorials and documentation that we can use.

# Why Go for backend development?

1. It's easy to learn and the syntax is easy to read.
2. It's fast and supports a high number of concurrent connections per compute instance (tens of thousands).
3. There are a lot of high-quality Go libraries that we can use.
4. Go is popular for web development so there are a lot of tutorials and documentation that we can reference.
